# BIO 2026 Code
Code for part a's are in `q(1|2|3).rs`.  
Code for  b, c & d (if relevant) are in `q(1|2|3)(b|c|d).rs`. 

I've also cross compiled the part a executables (for x86_64-pc-windows-gnu) and put them here for marking, but 
if they fail to run for some reason, please contact me (03sbottingota@brightoncollege.net), and I'll sort it out.
